# Spry: Spring For Python

Spry is a lightweight framework written in Python, designed to provide similar features and convenience to the Java Spring Framework. It enables developers to build and manage Python web applications more easily, offering common enterprise-level features such as dependency injection, AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), and more.

## Features

- **Dependency Injection**: Manage dependencies between application components more easily, making code more modular and testable.
- **Simple and Easy to Use**: Spry is designed to be straightforward, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than the framework itself.
